    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Spaghetti is a long, thin, cylindrical type of pasta made from durum wheat semolina, known for its slightly firm texture when cooked to “al dente.” 
            Originating from Italy, spaghetti is a versatile dish that is often served with a wide range of sauces, the most common being marinara or Bolognese, made from tomatoes, garlic, herbs, and meat. 
            It’s frequently paired with parmesan or other cheeses and can also be accompanied by meatballs or vegetables. Spaghetti is boiled in salted water and can be enjoyed as a simple, everyday meal or as part of more elaborate Italian dishes.

                    <li>Add 1 tablespoon of salt to the water, then add the spaghetti.</li>
                    <li>Cook according to the package instructions (usually 8-10 minutes) until the spaghetti is “al dente.”</li>
                    <li>Drain and set aside, reserving about 1/2 cup of pasta water.</li>
                </ul>
