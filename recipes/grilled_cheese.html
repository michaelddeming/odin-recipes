    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A grilled cheese is a simple yet delicious sandwich made by grilling slices of bread with melted cheese between them. 
            Typically, butter is spread on the outer sides of the bread before grilling, giving the sandwich a golden, crispy exterior. 
            The cheese inside, often American, cheddar, or a mix of cheeses, becomes gooey and soft as it heats. 
            Itâ€™s often enjoyed as a quick meal or snack, and can be served plain or paired with additions like tomato soup, ham, or other ingredients for added flavor.</p>
